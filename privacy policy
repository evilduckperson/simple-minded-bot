Simple Minded – Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 5/20/2025

This Privacy Policy explains what information the Simple Minded Discord bot ("the Bot") collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that information.

Information We Collect
The Bot may collect the following information during use:

User IDs: Used to manage command sessions and stored only temporarily — deleted after command execution is complete.

Fishing Simulator Data: Stores Discord user IDs alongside in-game data like collected fish and in-game currency.

Timestamps: Collected briefly for features like the /quotify command and discarded after command use.

How We Use Your Information
To enable bot functionality and personalize experiences (e.g., save fishing progress).

Temporary data (like timestamps or IDs during command execution) is deleted as soon as it is no longer needed.

Data Storage
Fishing simulator data is stored in a local JSON file.

No data is shared with third parties.

We do not use analytics or tracking tools.

Data Deletion
You may request deletion of your stored data by emailing evilduckperson@gmail.com with your Discord User ID and your request. Troll, spam, or abusive requests will be ignored, and the sender may be blocked.

Children’s Privacy
The Bot is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 13, in compliance with Discord’s own Terms of Service.
